# Angular 2 and TypeScript Bare Bones Project

The Bare Bones project is an Angular 2 starter project that has the npm modules, 
configuration, scripts, folders and routing in place to make getting started 
with an Angular 2 project easy!

Here's what is in the project:

* Angular 2 scripts and TypeScript configuration are ready to go
* Angular 2 bootstrapper wired up to the app component
* App component with basic routing applied
* Homepage component 
* A single "feature" component (represents a custom feature your app would have)
* A simple data service to provide data and show dependency injection
* Routing between the homepage and the "feature"
* Bootstrap for CSS
* live-server used to launch the site and reload it as you make changes

It's a minimal app intended to get you up and running quickly so the rest is up to you!
